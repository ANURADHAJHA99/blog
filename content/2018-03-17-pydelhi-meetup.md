<p> The talk pushed a simple commit into an empty repository with a few commands </p>
<code>git init </code><br/>
<code>git remote add origin "link to repo url...." </code><br/>
<code>git add .</code><br/>
<code>git commit -m "init" </code><br/>
<code>git push -u origin master </code><br/>
<p> The first line creates an empty repository into your project dir</p> 
<p> The second line acts as a pointer for your git directory to your repository on Github/GitLab/whatever the link to which is defined by the origin </p>
<p> The third lines stages all your changes for the commit </p>
<p> The fourth lines commits your changes into the git file with a description "init" for initialise </p>
<p> The last line pushes your commits or changes into your repository</p>
